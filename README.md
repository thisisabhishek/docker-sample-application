into depth, it covers the following topics:

- Running your first container
- Building containers
- Learning what containers are running and removing them
- Using volumes to persist data
<!-- - Using bind mounts to support development
- Using container networking to support multi-container applications
- Using Docker Compose to simplify the definition and sharing of applications
- Using image layer caching to speed up builds and reduce push/pull size
